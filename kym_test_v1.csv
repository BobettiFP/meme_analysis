It eventually gained 1 million views and would be linked in the replies of the tweets during the debate (shown below).  As the arguments developed, the characteristics of each side became more fleshed out. Those supporting the Pokémon (also known as ""lion deniers"") typically referred to the powers of legendary Pokémon, like Arceus and Mewtwo .

Do you want the world to know you? Alex: No. Ow! My Ass!: A lot of people want to know who you are. We get dozens of emails everyday at 1guyand1cup.com. Who are you?  Alex: I'm just a manager, I'm married, and I'm not gay! Ow! My Ass!: I think the most asked question is, ""Why didn't you go to the hospital?"" Alex: I was afraid of what they might ask. Ow! My Ass!: So, are you married? Does your wife know? Alex: I have been married 2 times. The first marriage lasted 7 years. The current marriage has lasted 11. I have two boys also, they are ages 5 and 17. And my family doesn't know. Ow! My Ass!: How long have you been sticking things in your anus? Alex: I've been doing this for 12 years, I am 40 now. I started with a coke bottle. I hope to get larger objects than even the jar in the video soon. Ow! My Ass!: So getting back to the hospital. Didn't it hurt? Why didn't you scream? Alex: For three days it bleed. It hurt really bad for two weeks. I still have two shards of glass in my anus from it. I didn't scream because I didn't want my family to hear me. I was in pain. The new video is of me the day after cleaning it up in the shower. Ow! My Ass!: How big was the jar? Alex: 87 mm. Ow! My Ass!: Is there anything else you would like people to know? Alex: I uploaded this to let people know that sticking jars in your ass is dangerous. And because the video was really funny; well mostly because it's funny. Oh, I don't have scars on my ass. That was soap I used for lube. I forgot. I prefer a glass jar because the dimension is constant. Plastic bottle (even full of water) no hard and this diameter may be various.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/15-minute-city,,,Confirmed,2021,"The ""15-minute city"" term was originally coined by Carlos Moreno, an academic and an advisor to Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo. During Hidalgo's tenure, Paris saw notable improvements to bike lanes, as well as the decision to ban cars from the historic heart of the city starting in 2024. [1] Moreno and others argued that the 15-minute city idea could improve the health of residents by encouraging walking, strengthening community bonds and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. [2] As the idea became popularized in the early 2020s, and more aligned with climate-conscious advocates of zoning reform, it subsequently generated pushback among some online.  A December 13th, 2022, article in Expose News [5] (a British conspiracist website) accused planners of 15-minute cities of attempting to bring ""Climate Change lockdowns,"" and a graphic referring to the article circulated on Twitter, Instagram and other platforms among conspiracy-minded users shortly after (seen below). The conspiracy centered around the idea that the goal of 15-minute cities would be to combine them with new digital surveillance technologies and create an ""open-air prison,"" though no evidence of this exists.",,"11,379",,"The 15-Minute City or Fifteen-Minute City is an urban planning concept that argues cities should be constructed so that people can access all the services and supplies they need within a 15-minute walk of where they live.

In early 2023, a series of conspiracy theories linked to QAnon speculated that global elites wanted to impose the 15-minute city on people so that they could be more easily controlled and surveilled. In late 2022 and early 2023, the slang term was also referenced in various memes , particularly on Twitter.",,,"Jordan Peterson promoted the theory on December 31st, 2022, arguing that the plan would curtail liberty and tell people where to live (seen below, left).

[4]  In the late winter of 2022, conspiracy influencers continued to post about the theory online, and it then broke through into the mainstream heading into early 2023. Some mocked those who posted these conspiracy theories, such as Twitter user @0xAltmsivi, [8] who received almost 4,100 likes (seen below, left) in two days for a February 20th, 2023, post, and @ButtPraxis, who received over 300 likes for posting a Breezewood, Pennsylvania meme (seen below, right) about the subject on February 21st.

In the article, titled ""US Safety Agency to Consider Ban on Gas Stoves Amid Health Fears,"" Trumka said that gas stoves were a ""hidden hazard"" and ""any option is on the table"" to deal with them. [1] Trumka's claims were based on research published in 2022, which reported that gas stoves might be responsible for up to 13 percent of childhood asthma cases in the U.S. [2] Trumka and others had reportedly floated the possibility of a ban on new gas stoves as early as December 14th, 2022, however.

The hoax also notably incited false claims that the Biden Administration wanted to ban such stoves from American homes. The origination of the controversy began when studies published at the end of 2022 found that gas stoves increased the risk of asthma in children, with government officials then commenting on these studies shortly after and provocative news coverage subsequently going viral. A heated debate ensued, with many on the right claiming that the government aimed to confiscate gas stoves and others on the left making fun of these fears.",,,"Articles about the connection between gas stoves and asthma appeared in publications like The Washington Post and The Guardian in the first week of 2023, leading to some online commentary.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/48293,,,Confirmed,2011,"On April 7th, 2011, a user of the local Texas message board Hot Pursuit [3] known as al_carl polled other users about the equation 48÷2(9+3), found in his son's homework the previous night. He offered four different answers, 2, 3.14, 219 and 288. The answers were relatively evenly split, with 50 people choosing 2 and 55 choosing 288. The question generated 95 replies of debate about the correct answer.",,"1,031,028",,"48÷2(9+3) = ? is a math problem that leads to two different answers depending on the order of operations [1] used. Since 2011, message board users have debated over whether 2 or 288 is the correct answer to the problem, with no conclusive answer. This and another seemingly impossible equations have been a hot topic of forum debate that are sometimes used to troll other posters who will vehemently argue that their answer is the definitive one.",,,"Later that day, someone reposted the equation to the Bodybuilding.com message board [4] , where more than 2,500 replies were posted. Also on April 7th, debate about the equation took place on dozens of message boards, ranging from communities surrounding broad topics to fan spaces for local sports teams including the Physics Forums [5] , Wall Street Oasis [6] , MSU Red Cedar [7] , Grass City [8] , Tennis Warehouse [9] , Inside MD Sports [10] and The Ecapist. [11] Later that day, the equation was posed on Yahoo ! Answers [11] , where the user Phyxius Ænimus broke down the two approaches to the problem, noting that sometimes math does not provide definitive answers.  The next day, additional discussions of the equation took place on the Sneaker Talk forums [12] , Yahoo! Answers Australia [13] and DIY Mobile Audio. [14] The reason different calculators offer different answers to the equation depends on how the machine interprets the order of operations. Most calculators follow the traditional order, completing expressions within brackets before anything else, resulting in an answer of 288, as determined by WolframAlpha [17] and Google. [18] In this case, the problem is solved as follows: However, others will follow PEMDAS, a mnemonic term that stands for Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction. By this logic, multiplication must take place before division, resulting in solving the problem as follows: Order of Operations and PEMDAS are not the only rules that can be applied to complete the equation. If one applies the distributive property, which requires numbers outside of an equation in parentheses be multiplied to each number in the enclosed equation separately, both results of 2 and 288 can be observed, depending on whether or not the division takes place first. There is also an argument [15] that implied multiplication, as seen in the algebraic phrase 2x takes precedence over explicit multiplication using the ""x"" symbol. For example, in the problem 2/5x, the implicit multiplication suggested by 5x would come before the explicit division of 2/5. Following this logic, the equation can be solved as follows: The final approach suggests the obelus, the term for the symbol ""÷"", represents the division of all terms preceding it by all terms after it [20] [21] , separating the two components of the equation at hand. Using this interpretation, the equation is solved like so:",,,https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/548/yourewrong.jpg

Sometimes referred to as ""Spider-Man '67,"" the series was notorious for its bad art and often over-the-top script as early as 2004. [7] The show reached a newfound audience in 2009 after Marvel officially began streaming the episodes via its website on April 2nd, 2009. [8] The episodes were subsequently reviewed on geek culture blogs like Topless Robot [9] and Daily Pop [10] . The image macro originated on 4chan some time in 2009 after users of the board /co/ (cartoon) began threads inviting fellow users to watch original episodes of the show together via streaming services. The overuse of stock animation like images of Spider-Man swinging across skylines was representative of the show's low-budget production, leading to plenty of funny, awkward or odd moments throughout the series.  After the viewing of each episode, users would post screenshots in the thread with summaries of episode highlights. One of the earliest instances of such threads on 4chan dates back to July 19th, 2009 [5] titled ""Spider-man on his day off.""

Once the user chose a ""left"" or ""right"" option, the non-chosen option would change, prompting them to choose again. Eventually, the filter's user would have their final option, ultimately highlighting their answer to the filter's question (example shown below). @melodii_cos I fixed the filter 😁😈 #fypシ゚viral #demonslayer #filter #effect #fyp ♬ original sound – ☆𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖗𝖎𝖟𝖚𝖐𝖚☆  Starting in mid-May 2023, creators of 777 filters started to insert Rule 34 pornography into their filters.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/abridged-series,,,Confirmed,2006,"Starting July 14th, 2006, Martin Billany (screen-named LittleKuriboh) [2] released a condensed spoof of the popular anime Yu-Gi-Oh , titled Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series [3] . The series consisted in parodying the absurdity of the plot of Yu-Gi-Oh while using outside references. His dubbing talent gave great entertainment from an otaku to an audience which, for the most part, was basically unfamiliar with the show itself. Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series is a dramatically shortened-down version of the original anime series, cutting each episode down from its original twenty minutes. The series is focused on making fun of the eccentricities of Yu-Gi-Oh!’s premise, and most prominently the fact that Duel Monsters is a children's card game, yet is played by teenagers and adults alike with unfaltering seriousness and decisive real-life consequences. This leads to frequent commentaries about the role of the game in the series. It also lampoons the changes made to the series in 4Kids TV’s English dub, and greatly exaggerates the characters' personalities from that version, to humorous effects. Moreover, it frequently displays pop-culture references, including some about fellow abridged series later on, and it regularly breaks the fourth wall .",,"156,730",,"Abridged Series is a subgenre of video parody that involves narrating the condensed version of a popular media, often poking fun at its faulty or unconventional premise and plotlines.

For a long time, he was even excluded from Youtube’s Top Subscribed lists.

DBZA’s entire playlist was blocked two times on Youtube, in December 2015 [70] and April 2017 [71] , and the channel TeamFourStar was even outright deleted in February 2016, each time after complaints from Toei Animation. Each time, TeamFourStar contested the copyright strike and succeeded. Many fans criticized the last bans, arguing that nothing could justify them after the first one was overruled. The outrage was especially high for the 2016 ban, which happened in the midst of the Where’s The Fair Use campaign . Some other people argued that by using its channel to promote its Patreon page, TeamFourStar was technically making money off of unauthorized copyrighted material. In early 2018, StateAlchemist’s Youtube channel was closed due to an official complaint from Toei Animation. In a video [71] , he explained how this was probably due to the studio’s belief that he was uploading unedited official French-dubbed episodes, and how he had to go to court and demonstrate his videos were a parody in order to get his channel back.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/agenda-21,,,Confirmed,1998,"Agenda 21 was first published as the product the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1993. It has since been ratified by the following conferences. The 700 page policy document, which is non-binding, gives directions that can be adapted by localities for managing the changes facing the environment through sustainable growth and planning in the areas of urban development, resource management, and pollution control. [1] Many of the guidelines have been opposed, especially from the viewpoint of those who believe in Libertarian property rights, since the document was first released. According to the Southern Law Poverty Center, far-right conservative groups like the John Birch Society ""see Agenda 21 and virtually all other global efforts as part of a nefarious plan on the part of global elites to form a socialistic one-world government, or 'New World Order.'"" [2] These groups believe that Agenda 21 will result in mass sterilization and other forms of population control, the loss of all local property rights through ""greenwashing"", and other forms of societal brainwashing. The earliest and one of the most vocal critics was a man named Tom Deweese, who runs an organization called the American Policy Center, and who began producing anti Agenda 21 literature in the 1990s. [3] [4]",,"13,685",,"Agenda 21 is an action plan created by the United Nations to give guidelines to localities regarding sustainable development and planning in the 21st Century.

[6] The initial book reached number 319 in the Amazon sales category for Conspiracies, while the latter made it even higher, to number #204. [7]  Other notable authors who have written books supporting Agenda 21 include 2011's Behind the Green Mask: U.N. Agenda 21 by Rosa Koire [8] and 2012's Living with Agenda 21: Surrendering Our Freedoms by Dr. Lawrence H. Zillmer.

One of the largest groups is the ""Resist U N Agenda 21"" closed group on Facebook , [10] which has more than 1,900 members. In addition, the subreddit /r/agenda21 was created on May 24th, 2012, and has 186 members. [11] A directory of other groups anti-agenders can join is available on the Tea Party's web site.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/akita-neru,,,Confirmed,2007,"The birth of Akita Neru is deeply related to a bunch of unfortunate events on mass media and major search engines which took place in the middle of October, 2007. [2] [3] Those incidents led Japanese internet users to have strong doubt over the existence of the Anti-Miku negative campaign created by Japanese major advertising agencies and TV stations. In this situation, many strange comments had been posted to a series of threads in 2channel's /newsplus/ (news coverage for current topics) board, which worked as a sort of the headquarters against this topic. Those comments were usually posted at intervals of a few seconds, and always contained messages such as ""It's our misunderstood. Let's call it quits."", ""I'm tired."" or ""It's over. I'm going to sleep."" in a quite similar style. 2channel users doubted that trolls of posting those comments were ""provocateurs"" organized by media companies and advertising agencies which wanted to calm down this situation. The situation was completely changed on October 20th, by a trap post with a URL which recorded and displayed IP address of clicked users. One of the domains captured by this trap was identified that it belonged to an online marketing company which worked on online forums such as 2channel to moderate reputations of client companies. At that moment, when all users became convinced of the existence of provocateurs, all troll posts ended. Based on this prologue, the character was created to poke fun at those poor trolls by user Smith Hioka (スミス・ヒオカ). The first illustration titled ""Kakikoloid: Akita Neru"" (Post-loid: Akita Neru) was posted to 2channel's /newsplus/ board on November 1st, 2007.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/albert-einstein-copypasta,,,Confirmed,1999,"According to Snopes , [1] an early version of the copypasta began circulating via e-mail as early as 1999. In the story, a college professor asserts that God must be evil if evil exists in the world, to which a student responds that “evil is simply the absence of God.” The final line reveals the student’s identity as Albert Einstein.  Does evil exist? The university professor challenged his students with this question. Did God create everything that exists? A student bravely replied, ""Yes, he did!"" ""God created everything? The professor asked. ""Yes sir"", the student replied. The professor answered, ""If God created everything, then God created evil since evil exists, and according to the principal that our works define who we are then God is evil"". The student became quiet before such an answer. The professor was quite pleased with himself and boasted to the students that he had proven once more that the Christian faith was a myth. Another student raised his hand and said, ""Can I ask you a question professor?"" ""Of course"", replied the professor. The student stood up and asked, ""Professor, does cold exist?"" ""What kind of question is this? Of course it exists. Have you never been cold?"" The students snickered at the young man's question. The young man replied, ""In fact sir, cold does not exist. According to the laws of physics, what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat. Every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy, and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy. Absolute zero (-460 degrees F) is the total absence of heat; all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature. Cold does not exist. We have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat."" The student continued, ""Professor, does darkness exist?"" The professor responded, ""Of course it does."" The student replied, ""Once again you are wrong sir, darkness does not exist either. Darkness is in reality the absence of light. Light we can study, but not darkness. In fact we can use Newton's prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color. You cannot measure darkness. A simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it. How can you know how dark a certain space is? You measure the amount of light present. Isn't this correct? Darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present."" Finally the young man asked the professor, ""Sir, does evil exist?"" Now uncertain, the professor responded, ""Of course as I have already said. We see it every day. It is in the daily example of man's inhumanity to man. It is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world. These manifestations are nothing else but evil."" To this the student replied, ""Evil does not exist sir, or at least it does not exist unto itself. Evil is simply the absence of God. It is just like darkness and cold, a word that man has created to describe the absence of God. God did not create evil. Evil is not like faith, or love that exist just as does light and heat. Evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.""

The system begun operating on two axis by the 1977 release of Dungeons and Dragons [1] , one consisting of ""Lawful"", ""Neutral"", and ""Chaotic"", and the other of ""Good"", ""Neutral"", and ""Evil""; you would combine one of the traits of the first axis with one of the traits of the other, thus resulting in alignments such as ""Lawful Good"" or ""Chaotic Evil"", with nine possible alignments in total. 5×5 Alignment Charts were never designed by the official game. Instead, the additional categories for both axis -- social and rebel; and moral and impure respectively -- are products from the internet . The earliest known instances of a 5×5 Alignment Chart being used dates back to June 5, 2011, when the DeviantArt account DoASpotCheck uploaded their 5 by 5 Alignment Chart comprised of different characters from various subcultures that they feel epitomizes each category. [6]",,"506,074",,"Alignment Charts (also known as Character Alignments ) refer to images presenting different categorized subjects -- usually nine -- in a manner that strongly resembles Demotivational Posters . Images within alignment charts usually show characters from a particular subculture (with either a quote or a reasoning below the title of the character's alignment to reflect why they are in that position), but the chart manages to reach levels of irony that reaction images , inanimate objects, and even food can be grouped and categorized.",,,"The concept has been implemented by fans in other works of fiction once it has gained traction. The practice of categorizing subjects in forums and image boards has often brought much debate and criticism due to disagreements from all sides. [3] [7] This all becomes a meme with the practice of taking images of characters (or concepts, or a variety of other things) and (usually in the form of a demotivational poster) labeling them as one of the nine alignments. This is then expanded upon by editing together such images (usually following a theme) into a chart, thus giving a representation of the conventional nine alignments -- 5×5 charts with a total of 25 alignments exist. Images dealing with just one of the alignments, or just with the subject of alignment itself, also exist. For example, on July 23rd, 2017, Twitter user @tinysubversions [10] posted an alignment chart of Dungeons and Dragons alignments that gained over 2,000 retweets and 3,800 likes (shown below, left). Another popular joke version was posted on August 10th of that year by @aurelianrabbit which made each space on the chart a way to store bread. The tweet gained over 25,000 retweets and 59,000 likes (shown below, right).  As for the actual origins of this practice, things aren't very clear, but many demotivationals exist. Such comparisons have been made since the first release of Dungeons and Dragons, though it's possible that the book Complete Scoundrel , published in 2007, may have popularized the concept. Many decades after the concept was made famous, Alignment Charts remain a popular subject for discussion and deviation in online communities. By 2012 a crude template for the alignment chart was made available on Polyvore by user ellerigby13. 74 deviations were produced from this template. [8] A subreddit with 1,537 readers exists that showcases alignment charts submitted by users. [4] On DeviantArt, there is a considerably large number of around 34,000 deviations under the tag ""character alignment.""

Some speculate that Mitchell may have committed suicide because he was being sexually abused by his father [1] , and that the loss of his iPod may have convinced him to do it. The usage of the phrase refers to the idea that committing suicide is implied to be heroic by the comment left on the memorial page for Mitchell, which then began to be used as a phrase by trolls for 'shock value' to mock Mitchell and shock mourners.",,"1,872,674",,,,,"After Mitchell's obituary was published, a clipping was posted to MyDeathSpace.com in 2006, and eventually to 4chan's /b/ board, where the term began to pick up usage for referring to suicides, as well as a synonym for ""Kill Yourself"" in reference to posts considered bad on 4chan. [3] [4] On September 2nd, 2006, a definition for the term was submitted to Urban Dictionary by user ""4chananonymous"" [2] , defining the phrase as: To commit suicide, regardless of how stupid the reason is or is not. Someone stole Mitchell's iPod, so he became an hero. To commit suicide, regardless of how stupid the reason is or is not. Someone stole Mitchell's iPod, so he became an hero. Two years later, the New York Times published an article about the troll campaign surrounding Henderson and the ""an hero"" meme. In their report, the Times writes that the deceased parents were harassed by prank phonecallers in the year and a half following his death, while other created memes and placed references to the meme at his grave (shown below). They wrote: Someone hacked Henderson’s MySpace page and gave him the face of a zombie. Someone placed an iPod on Henderson’s grave, took a picture and posted it to /b/. Henderson’s face was appended to dancing iPods, spinning iPods, hardcore porn scenes. A dramatic re-enactment of Henderson’s demise appeared on YouTube, complete with shattered iPod. The phone began ringing at Mitchell’s parents’ home. “It sounded like kids,” remembers Mitchell’s father, Mark Henderson, a 44-year-old I.T. executive. “They’d say, ‘Hi, this is Mitchell, I’m at the cemetery.’ ‘Hi, I’ve got Mitchell’s iPod.’ ‘Hi, I’m Mitchell’s ghost, the front door is locked. Can you come down and let me in?’ ” He sighed. “It really got to my wife.” The calls continued for a year and a half.

The match came to a halt during injury time of the second half after a riot erupted in the stadium.

Becker did end up writing the testament, (shown below, right). After Becker issued the testimonial, he issued an apology to Albino Blacksheep (shown below). He also sent back the $250 Bauman sent him and demanded to get the flash and statement removed from the site. The animation was removed from eBaum's World on June 26, 2006.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/anime-openingending-parodies,,,Confirmed,,"The practice of fan-made OP/ED parody videos started when video tapes became mainstream in 1980’s. The earliest instances of the parody videos were created by college anime circles or indie movie groups, and had been shared through small indie film events, doujin convention, or hand delivery among otaku people. Famous instances in this pre-internet era are ""Aura Farmer Combine"" (農耕士コンバイン, Noukoushi Combine ) and the opening movie of ""C3B"" (CardCaptor Cherry Blossom). The former is an all hand-drawn animated parody film for a TV anime Aura Battler Dunbine [1] , which was created by Akita University Animation Club members in 1985. The latter is a live-action parody for a TV anime Cardcaptor Sakura . [2] This weird parody video was released at a doujin convention by Nagoya-residing doujin groups on February 2000.  OP/ED parody had been also one of the standard styles in MAD videos since its birth in the same mid-1980s. Among them, ""Otaku no MAD Video"" series by Hajioh (はじおう) and The Fake OP Video Committee (インチキOP制作委員会) in 1997-1998 is known as the pioneer of online MAD videos, and it contained many OP parody style videos as its name suggests. In addition, the Japanese 2channel -led flash movie creation movement in the first half of 2000s was also triggered by well-made anime parodies. A Japanese flash animation creator Wosa's anime OP parody series featuring 2channel Shift-JIS art characters is known as the originator of anime parodies in the movement. However, these videos were usually taken down by the creators within a short period or distributed among fans in the underground web culture via anonymous uploaders or P2P softwares because of the copyright issues.  The popularization of YouTube in 2006 and the launch of the Japanese video sharing service Nico Nico Douga in the following year drastically changed consciousness of the copyrights among both people and Japanese media companies. The breakthrough was brought by fan works for the OP/ED movies "" Hare Hare Yukai "" and "" Motteke! Sailor Fuku "" from Kyoto Animation 's hit titles The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Lucky Star . A huge amount of tributes for the movies openly took the online video hub sites by storm in late-2000s, and many copyright holders became not to frequently remove online fan creations utilizing their contents except for several rigid media companies.

Many series have multiple openings and endings and the songs for these are usually done by famous Japanese bands and artists. Many video games also have animated openings.

[6] [8] [9]",,"59,944",,"Animutation (a portmanteau of ""animation"" & ""mutation"") is a genre of animation that uses vast array of pop culture references to create a humorous and often shabby-looking video. Generally, the animation is set to foreign or gibberish music that lends to the structured randomness of the video. Additionally, the creator occasionally gives ""misheard"" English subtitles (known as soramimis [10] ) for the video, similar to Phonetic Translations .",,,"On June 14th, 2001, Cicierega released ""The Japanese Pokerap."" Occasionally cited as the first Animutation. On Newgrounds, [2] [3] the video received more than 132,000 views in 17 years. On April 27th, 2012, YouTuber Ashkdies posted the video to YouTube [15] . The post received more than 10,000 views in six years (Animutation Archive reupload shown below, left). [1] Later that year, on November 26th, 2001, Animutation artist Veloso released ""Irrational Exuberance."" [12] The video was reuploaded to YouTube on January 20th, 2010 [16] , where it received more than 150,000 views in nearly nine years (4K repload shown below, right).  Animutation shares many of the traits of ""Cutout Animation,"" found in the work of seminal British sketch comedy group Monty Python , or the American animated series South Park (Python example below, left). The first recorded use of cutout animation was produced by Argentinian animator Quirino Cristiani in the early 1900s (example below, right). [4]   Even though ""The Japanese Pokerap"" is established as the ever first Animutation, several fans of the Animutation genre of flash animation believe that the 2000 video Hatten är din can be considered as the first Animutation seeing as it bears the necessary qualities of an Animutation and precedes ""The Japanese Pokerap"" by about a year (shown below). Cicierega has cited this video as an influence. [5]  On February 15th, 2005, the Wiki ""Fanmutations"" launched. [11] Currently, the site holds a large list of different videos, many of which exist on Newgrounds, Animutation Portal, YouTube, and Albino Blacksheep. Fanimutations are generally created with flash, and though many creators have uploaded versions of the videos to YouTube, they retain a higher quality in their original format.  Some popularly known people and fictional characters often recur in several Animutations. This list contains the most notable of those characters. Adolf Hitler Alex Chiu Bill Gates Colin Mochrie (The staple Animutation character) George W. Bush Matthew Lesko Michael Jackson Mr. T Dancing Banana Darth Vader Domo-kun Harry Potter Hello Kitty Homer Simpson Jay Jay the Jet Plane Mario Mink Pac-Man Pee-wee Herman Pikachu Ronald McDonald Santa Claus Sonic the Hedgehog SpongeBob SquarePants Zippy A plastic statue of Jesus, more commonly referred to as ""Jesus H. Christ"" Because of legal issues concerning some pop culture characters being featured in Animutations, some of the videos had to be edited so as to be posted on YouTube again. One notable example is an Animutation known as JamezBond. After Randy Costan filed a copyright claim against using his image in videos not his, the creator of the Animutation, Dwedit replaced Peter Pan Guy with a green silhouette version of the man with text below him that reads "" DMCA Violation.""

In the article, the author writes the various results of what could happen if Ant-Man performed the theory. Alex Klotz from MIT said: If Ant-Man were more fluid as he expanded, he would splurt through the two sphincters on either side of the rectum, out of the anus and into the colon. However, based on videos of him shrinking and growing, it looks like he can only expand isotropically, without changing shape. I can think of three possibilities: he just gets stuck, rectum-sized, until he shrinks again; [he] tries to expend but builds up so much pressure that it kills him; [Ant-man splurts] out of the anus.  Ultimately, he concludes that because of both Thanos' strength and the power of the Power Stone, Thanos' body may be more resilient than normal. Therefore, Ant-Man might not burst through Thanos' entire body. Klotz says, ""Each tissue and connection in the body has its own strength and its own limits, so even if he can expand through the rectal wall, I don’t know if, for example, the same could be said about breaking the pelvis."" So Ant-Man may burst through the anus, but possibly not the entirety of Thanos' body. ""Literally tearing him a new one will do plenty of damage in its own right and at the very least [it’ll] be extremely unpleasant.""

The synopsis for the book reads: ""t’s up to Antguy to use his amazing powers, shrinking himself down, entering Thamos’ butt, then blowing up extra large."" The book soon went to #1 on Amazon's Fantasy Erotica rankings.

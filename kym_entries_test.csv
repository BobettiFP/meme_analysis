Those who support the lions have much simpler answers, citing the fact that ""1 billion is a lot"" as well as possible humorous tactics lions could take, the most notable being ""lion ladders.""",,,"On November 4th, 2015, Jason Zimmerman, also known as Mew2King , posted the question on his own Twitter account.

It eventually gained 1 million views and would be linked in the replies of the tweets during the debate (shown below).  As the arguments developed, the characteristics of each side became more fleshed out. Those supporting the Pokémon (also known as ""lion deniers"") typically referred to the powers of legendary Pokémon, like Arceus and Mewtwo . Those who supported the lions typically used more comical responses involving comedic strategies lions could use. For example, when countering arguments about some Pokémon being able to live in space, a lion supporter would respond with ""they could hold their breath."" The commonly cited ""lion ladders"" or other derivates, like ""lion rafts"" began developing in the reply sections of the tweets (example shown below).  Lion supporters also joked about the Pokémon side being too serious about their arguments or having too complex of an argument in a similar manner to Godzilla vs. Kong debates. The debate continued to be referenced occasionally after the peak of the meme, but the topic remained largely dormant over the next five years.
